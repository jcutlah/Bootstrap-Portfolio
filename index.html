                    <img src="assets/images/jamesCutlerProfile.jpg">Hi Friend, thanks for visiting my page. As I'm trying to grow my skills (and career) in web development, I hope you enjoy the subtle, stylistic enhancements I've made to the pre-defined layout I've been made to copy. If anything seems off, or you're lonely and wanna say hi, feel free to leave me a note on my <a href="contact.html" >contact page</a>! In full transparency though, that form doesn't currently do anything, and it'd be cool if you followed my <a href="https://github.com/jcutlah">GitHub</a> or something...
                </p>
                <p class="about-description">
                    Alrighty then, how about two truths and a lie: My first broken bone was via the front right wheel of a GMC Denali SUV (3 broken bones in left foot) when I was 16; I was harpooned in my left thigh while spearfishing with a friend off the isle of St. John, US Virgin Islands on spring break (arterial wounds really do bleed <em><strong>a lot</strong></em>); I passed out right before being loaded onto a life flight to Salt Lake City, Utah, where I would undergo back to back brain and spinal surgeries.

                    Maybe you're still interested in some more James Cutler fun facts. Here are a few:
                    <ul class='fun-facts'>
                        <li>I'm married to my lovely wife named Katie, and we have a pretty awesome son named Elwyn. And a dog named Toby. (Queue the white picket fence joke.)</li>
                        <li>I like the outdoors. While I don't frequent it as much as I used to during my carefree 20's, I still have aspirations to climb big mountains around the world. </li>
                        <li>Besides a HTML class I briefly took in high school, I started learning to code when I started working at HubSpot.</li>
