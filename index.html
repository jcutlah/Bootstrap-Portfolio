                    <img src="assets/images/jamesCutlerProfile.jpg">James Cutler has worked for 3+ years at HubSpot, currently as a Website Technical Consultant on their Website Migrations team. In his role, he works with HTML/CSS/JS and HubL (a Jinja-based language specific to HubSpot.) He also consults with Migrations customers and provides DNS/go-live assistance. In his spare time, he has become proficient in Python and REST API usage. Using Google Cloud Platform to host his Python applications, he has been able to permanently solve a number of business challenges that were faced by his team at HubSpot.
